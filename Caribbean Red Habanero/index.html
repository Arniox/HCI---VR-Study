    <!-- Introduction _______________________________________________________________________  Introduction  -->


    <div class="panels" id="Introduction">
    <h1 class="header"> Introduction </h1>
    <p>In the world of digital age, human reliance on technology is widely evident in different environments, spanning from average households to
      large corporate companies. We have decided to undertake a ethnographic study analysing a Virtual Reality (VR) learning tool developed by our
      group, that enables employers to train and test staff on identifying common hazards in the workplace. Through an unstructured, free-flowing
      style of research, we conducted individual sessions to test the tool and used thematic analysis of the data to find its strengths and weaknesses. </p>
    <p>Through the use of the game engine Unity3D, we created an office environment specifically for this assignment. Participants can explore and identify
      hazards that could be common in an office workplace (see figure 1). The participants are then fitted with a VR headset and are able to move around
      the environment freely using the teleportation feature and the VR controllers. The office environment contained a variety of rooms including a
      kitchen, offices and a meeting area allowing for a range of hazards to be added.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this study was to analyse a VR learning tool that we as a group decided to create in order to fill a gap in the training programs
      currently available for health and safety in  workplaces. We believe this tool could be used to create safer environments for staff and prevent
      potential injuries. Due to the tool being in early phases of development, we had decided an ethnographic study would be most beneficial as there
      was no need for a hypothesis at this stage in development. An in depth explanation of the methodology follows in the next section.</p>

  <!-- Methodology _______________________________________________________________________  Methodology  -->


  <div class="panelsGrey" id="Methodology" >
    <h1 class="header"> Methodology </h1>
    <p>As discussed in the introduction above, we decided upon a qualitative exploratory study for this usability test as the virtual reality
      program was only in its first phase of testing and therefore had no specific hypothesis attached to it. We simply wanted to discover more
      about what we had done well, what might be in need of improvement and, if we were lucky, to uncover some new angles we hadn’t even considered
      ("When to Use Quantitative Methods ", n.d.).</p>
    <p>For the test itself, we chose to implement a free-flowing, open, and friendly research style, as outlined by Carter in his 2007 article
      “Liberating Usability Testing”. Here he describes the significant benefits of undertaking usability studies in this manner - conducted in a
      way that can best be described as “inquiry within experience” (p. 18, para.1), and being “alongside someone as they use something…” in order
      to “find out how it’s going” (p. 22, para.3). </p>
      <img src="assets/Figure2.jpg" class="Figure" id="Figure2"/>
      <p class="FigureText"> Figure 2: Participant during the session. </p>
      <p>Unlike more restrictive methods of qualitative research, such as interviews and questionnaires, this method allows for greater discovery on
        the part of the researchers, and a more engaging and human experience for the participants. Importantly, the moderator should attempt to tease
        as much feedback from the subjects as they can without breaking their concentration by asking too many questions, or by leading them with said
        questions (see figure 2). </p>
      <p>We decided upon a short warm up period for each participant, where our moderator would describe the task to them and allow them a few minutes to get
        the hang of navigating with the VR wand. This warm up period is also a good opportunity for our moderator to build trust and establish a friendly
        dialogue between himself and the participant (Carter, 2007).</p>

    <p>When they were comfortable in the environment, we began the test, recording each session on video and taking notes of any pertinent or
      particularly striking details.</p>
<p>Upon completion of testing, we used thematic analysis to examine the data. Thematic analysis is a useful method for analysing qualitative data,
  especially that of an exploratory study where the themes aren’t known and must be established post-study. It proceeds through a process of “data
  familiarisation, data coding, and theme development and revision” ("About thematic analysis", n.d., para. 4).This initially involved familiarizing
  ourselves with all of our notes and video, and discussing these amongst ourselves. We established some tentative codes, or commonalities from the
  data, before using the NVivo software to collate the video transcripts and notes to establish more concrete codes (see figure 3). NVivo is helpful
  to cut through the masses of video or audio data researchers might have, and to do some of the heavy lifting in terms of organising the transcripts.
  During this part of the thematic analysis, many of the codes, or nodes, were changed and refined to better reflect the data by constantly asking
  questions of the data in order to spot patterns and commonalities (Lazar, Feng & Hochheiser, 2010).</p>
<p>Once all the relevant data had been assigned to the codes, we ran data queries in NVivo in order to facilitate the development of themes.
  We then reviewed these themes by looking again at the raw data to ensure they all fit, updating and tweaking as we went. Constantly returning
  to the original raw data is a core tenet of thematic analysis, and allows for the somewhat abstract process of thematic development to remain
  grounded in reality (Myers, 1997). </p>

<p>Finally, we took these now concrete themes and developed their scope and “story” to provide a complete picture of the primary discoveries of
  our usability study.</p>

      through Nvivo and then developed them into main themes. This journey can be seen below through the different stages of our investigation. </p>

    <!-- Main Themes _______________________________________________________________________  Main Themes  -->

    <h2 class="subheader">Main Themes</h2>

    <p class="subsubheader">Design/layout issues:</p>
    <p>The largest category in the overall negative sentiment code is from the “Design” code (see figure 6). The data transcripts included
      many references to poor design and layout, as well as indications of the confusion this caused the participants.</p>

    <p class="subsubheader">Physical movement:</p>
    <p>In the graph titled “Items Clustered by Word Similarity” (figure 4), one can see that the “Physical Movement” code and the “Very Negative
      Sentiment” code are very closely linked. This was clear even on the day of testing. Participants could not remain still while using the VR
      program. They were supposed to turn only in a circle, but otherwise remain in one position and use the controller for in-game movement. Without
      exception the participants needed to be “reset” by our moderator and returned to the centre of the testing area. The most common word in all
      our transcripts and observational data was “moving” or some variant like “move”. This word shows up in both the positive and negative sentiment
      codes (see appendix for additional graphs) due to its presence when data was also referring to in-game movement, but returning to the raw data
      shows any relation of this word to the physical movement of the subjects in the testing room was entirely negative.</p>

      <img src="assets/Figure8.jpg" class="Figure" id="Figure8"/>
      <p class="FigureText"> Figure 8: Participant having issues with navigation </p>

      <p class="subsubheader">Navigation difficulties:</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, negative sentiment and in-game navigation contained many similar words (see appendix for additional graphs). This is a
        strong reinforcement of the raw data and our own observations. “Navigation” and variations like “navigate” were some of the most commonly
        used words across all of the transcripts. Interestingly, there is still a strong positive element to this theme (see figure 7), this is due
        to the many references in the transcripts to the fact that the participants all achieved a good degree of competency by the end of the
        testing session.</p>

      <p class="subsubheader">Interest:</p>
      <p>The largest category in the positive sentiment code (figure 7), by quite a wide margin, was the “Interest” code. Participants were excited
        to use the VR program, and were eager to discover the hazards. This is supported by the “Interest” code receiving the highest number of
        references in the data out of all the codes (see figure 5). They were usually ready to continue exploring the environment if they had not
        found all the hazards. </p>

  <!-- Analysis _______________________________________________________________________  Analysis  -->


  <div class="panelsGrey" id="Analysis" >
    <h1 class="header"> Analysis and Discussion </h1>
    <p>VR has many different industrial, learning, and entertainment uses, and as studies have found (Zhou, Y., Ji, S., Xu, T., Wang, Z., 2018),
      VR for learning can be defined as one of two types: an instructing tool in teaching or as a learning environment in education. In our case,
      we have chosen to use VR as an instructing tool for enhancing hazard identification in the workplace. From the data, four main themes arose
      from our usability study. In the following discussion and analysis, the four themes will be deliberated.</p>

      <p>The most obvious from our testing, and the most commonly expressed theme across all participants, was the difficulty they had navigating
        and moving in the virtual reality environment (see figure 8). Although most were somewhat confident in this area by the end of their session,
        this seemed to be more by necessity than by an intuitive and natural learning curve. They quickly learnt that pointing the controllers too far
        ahead in the office would result in a huge leap across the room, through a wall, or even off the map itself. They learnt to take very small
        steps across the halls and offices - basically, to operate at a minimum of the game’s capacity for movement. In traditional video games,
        walls and physical colliders for the player are quite easy to set up by making sure the character is deprived of movement when they hit a wall.
        However in VR, this same limitation must be self managed since there are no dynamic borders to prevent the user from phasing through walls (Boldt,
        M., 2018). </p>

      <p>A self-imposed curbing of their movement ability could be seen as a positive – after all, they were learning the game’s boundaries and
        limitations thus freeing them up to focus on their tasks – however, the serious nature of the game’s purpose, and the implication that
        it was supposed to be a stand in for a real office environment made these difficulties in navigation a hindrance for the participants,
        and an unnecessary distraction away from the task. The navigation issues persisted with most of our participants, suggesting that although
        they understood the basic VR navigation methods, they never quite mastered it, which in turn caused some issues such as dizziness for one user
        and at least some disorientation for our other participants.</p>

        <p>As with any VR experience, immersion is key, and in some respects, the need each participant felt to physically move in the real world was
          an encouraging sign. But again, this could also be seen as an expression of their desire for a more intuitive and natural method of movement.
          Although it is true that those with prior VR experience moved about less than those with no prior experience, the fact is they all did it to
          one degree or another.</p>


        <p>Not necessarily directly related, but certainly contributing to the above, were problems with the design and layout of the environment itself.
          Some participants were enthusiastic about the VR office and its assortment of cubicles and desks and health and safety hazards, but all had
          criticisms and suggestions for improvement. One very common complaint was that “everything looks the same”. They didn’t know if they had already
          explored this area of the office because the desks and chairs and rooms all looked similar to some other area they had navigated through. This
          resulted in the need for the moderator to assist all participants, some more than others, in the navigation of the virtual space (see figure 9).</p>

          <img src="assets/Figure9.jpg" class="Figure" id="Figure9"/>
          <p class="FigureText"> Figure 9: Participant needing assistance with navigation </p>

          <p>Other criticisms from our participants included a variety of design flaws such as desks that appeared to be floating, as well as
            the inexplicable glass panel in the middle of the conference room. Some felt the lighting was not bright enough, or too constant –
            without the variation one would expect in a real office. Although not initially thought of as a flaw, we found that some participants
            were challenged with the fit and wearability from VR headset. This affected the immersion and enjoyment of the environment which included
            finding the headset too heavy to wear without support, and difficulties using it with glasses.</p>

           <p>Encouragingly, the interest among participants was very high. They were eager to try something new and to discover as many hazards as
             they could. They seemed to engage well with the moderator and were quick with suggestions for improvements, as well as with compliments
             on the program. However, it’s important to note that if the final hazards proved too difficult to find, or the layout confused them,
             they appeared to lose interest rather quickly. This is supported by findings from (Zhou, Y., Ji, S., Xu, T., Wang, Z., 2018), that
             show using VR to enrich learning environments has the capability to be effective but also poses many challenges including navigation
             and design issues. </p>

            <p>As another study found (Nijholt, A., Van Dijk, B., Bianchi-Berthouze, N., Pasch, M., 2009), the overarching fundamental framework
              for social transformation that covers game design, and VR design specifically, is “(1)capacity building, (2)group empowerment, (3)
              relational community-building and (4)culture challenge”. So, although our original intent for this study was to analyze the usefulness
               and strengths of our VR tool, capturing and maintaining our users’ interest with a larger assortment of hazards - perhaps also with
               some sort of reward mechanism, like a point scoring system - should be an area of careful consideration for any future evolutions of
               this VR program. </p>

            <p class="subsubheader">Limitations of the study </p>
            <p>The most prominent limitation we encountered during this study was time. Perhaps this was due to the ambitious nature of our project
              where we decided to both create the environment we were testing and complete the usability study within the timeframe. It’s a
              possibility that some of the negative results related to the lack of time, specifically with design and navigation issues that
              could have easily been solved if we had had more time for development. We feel as though a more rounded analysis could have been
              completed if we had had additional time for more participants and time to evaluate and analyse the videos with Nvivo.</p>

            <p class="subsubheader">Future Direction </p>
            <p>If we were to continue developing our VR learning tool, aside from dealing with the navigation, movement, and design issues,
              we would like to achieve a more immersive and realistic experience. This could be accomplished by addressing the above, but
              also modelling the environment off existing offices, and using better and less identifiable hazards. These might include cable
              management and the various ergonomic issues that may be present in an office environment. We believe there is also potential for
              other hazardous environments to be represented, for example the many dangers of a factory or a construction site - as explored in
              the study by Li, Chan, Skitmore (2011).</p>

    <!-- Conclusion _______________________________________________________________________  Conclusion  -->
    <div class="panels" id="Conclusion" >
      <h1 class="header"> Conclusion </h1>
      <p>To conclude, our thematic analysis approach towards usability testing has proven to be very effective. Our methodology yielded four main
        themes that was solidified by the qualitative data within the spectrum of positive and negative comments. This was gathered through a free
        flowing, open style of research that allowed us guide and observe different participants’ reactions and behaviours towards various challenges
        they encountered during their sessions. Through this, we understood that poor design and layout caused navigational difficulties for participants
        as they experienced loss of direction due to rooms having similar formats and our inability to prevent users from teleporting through walls.
        Despite the previously mentioned themes, all the participants were greatly intrigued with the instructing tool and displayed excitement when
        interacting with the environment. The users would occasionally walk around and peek through corners as they normally would in reality, exhibiting
        curiosity and a sense of immersion within the virtual world. Ultimately, utilizing virtual reality as an instructing tool to aid people can bear
        impactful results in the industry of today’s modern society but it does not come without its challenges proven by our usability test. This piece
        of research has barely scratched the surface of virtual reality’s full potential and yet it produced remarkable outcome and if taken to the next
        phase, can output even greater results.  </p>
